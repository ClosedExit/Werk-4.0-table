# Werk-4.0-table
A simple react-app with the topic called 'Plant watch'. My application features the latest version of the react-framework 'next.js 14', (performancewise).  Plants can be added into a table together with species, name and dates to observe the watering process. It'll also feature one of ant-designs table functionalities as syntactic sugar.
